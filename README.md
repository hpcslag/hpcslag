### Hi there ðŸ––

My name is Mac Taylor, I'm a **Backend Engineer** living in **Chiba, Japan**.

My work is related to blockchain and Web3., currently I'm an amateur NLP researcher, and my main research area is Automatic Theorem Proving based on Transformer LM Architecture. (P.S.: I work with a low-level transformer, not a Chat-GPT).

I work in multilingual development and am familiar with Python, C#, C++, Java, Golang, Elixir, Rust, and Javascript, also hands-on with electronics (STM32, 8051) and handmake circuits layout, and interested in Mathematical Analysis, currently practice Lebesgue and Measure Theory.

### Plan 2025

 - Rust / Conf-ops system building
 - Learning Japanese -> N3, Deutsch -> B1, French -> A2, Prepare IELTS
 - Busy with work and Conference (COSCUP)
 - Keep building our new developer geek community at Kaohsiung
 - NLP / Mathematical Language Processing -> IEEE Journal Submission / Manuscript
 - Regaining passion*
