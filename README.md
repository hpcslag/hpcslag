### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mac Taylor, I'm a Backend Engineer living in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

I switch the lang I write in depending on the situation, such as dealing with data, I will using **Python**, and working Web Application I will using **Golang**, and create a game I will using **Unity C#**, and play the SoC(STM32/C51) I will using **C**, that's funny.

**Java** is my first OOP language, I used work with Java few years, then I change to Golang.

So where is **Node.js**? Oh come on.

Roughly, I'm interested in Full-stack Web, 8051 SoC, and Mathematical analysis, and Education.

In the field of Machine Learning, I'm interested in NLP, and I have research in **Chinese Sentence Assertion**, **Stock Prediction: forced alignment sentiment with stock trend**(failed).

Also I have research with ***using HCCG-CycleGAN auto generated dataset feed to improve Mask-RCNN Recognition effect in Chinese Characters***.

### Plan 2021

 - Working with Funcational Programming.
 - Research in Probability and measure theory.
