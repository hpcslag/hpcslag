### Hi there ðŸ––

My name is Mac Taylor, I'm a <p style="background-image: linear-gradient(43deg, #4158D0 0%, #C850C0 46%, #FFCC70 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; transition: all .2s;">_ Developer</p> living in Tokyo, Japan.

My work is related to blockchain and Web3., currently I'm an amateur NLP researcher, and my main research area is Automatic Theorem Proving based on Transformer LM Architecture. (P.S.: I work with a low-level transformer, not a Chat-GPT).

I work in multilingual development and am familiar with Python, C#, C++, Java, Golang, Elixir, Rust, and Javascript, also hands-on with electronics (STM32, 8051) and handmake circuits layout, and interested in Mathematical Analysis, currently practice Lebesgue and Measure Theory.

### Plan 2024

 - Starting a new life in Japan
 - Learning Japanese -> N3, Deutsch -> B1, French -> A2, Prepare IELTS
 - Busy with work and Conference (COSCUP)
 - Keep building our new developer geek community at Kaohsiung
